# University thesis - Rubik's Cube recognizer and solver
The first app that solves a Rubik's cube using Beyer Hardwick method. It is meant to help people to learn this method. It uses machine learning (SVM and HOG descriptor) to recognise the colors from camera's input and a hand-implemented algorithm to generate the solution.
